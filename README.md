👋🏼 Hi, I’m twenty-two years old students at Wrocław University of Science and Technology and also at University of Economics.
I’m interested in traveling, exploring world and culture. I'm in love with all kinds of sport's activity, for example running, playing squash, snowboarding, hiking and swimming.
Currently i am exploring accounting and data analyst, nowadays writing bachelor's thesis on Benford Law and looking for a perspecive job as junior financial analyst and similar position.
If u want to reach me and maybe ask about cooperation, please write to romana1806@gmail.com. I am grateful for all of messages.
